Add HIPAA Compliant web forms easily to your Wordpress website using the HIPAA FORMS SaaS Service and Caldera or Gravity Forms.

== Description ==
The HIPAA FORMS plugin allows you to create web forms using Caldera Forms or Gravity Forms just like you would a simple contact form.  A simple checkbox next to the form within the plugin admin interface instantly takes over your form, appends the form with a HIPAA Compliant badge and signature field where users can sign by dragging their mouse or with their finger on touch screens, and upon submit encrypts the data and pushes it to the HIPAA FORMS Service API which then stores it within a HIPAA Compliant storage solution.

Users with login credentials and the appropriate user roles (administrator or hipaa) can then log into your Wordpress administrator dashboard and search/view the submitted forms and even generate an encrypted and password protected PDF file of the form which can then be printed or saved to a hard drive.

Here's how the HIPAA FORMS Service and integrated Wordpress plugin secures the protected health information of your forms:
1. On submit the entire form is encrypted requiring 2 separate keys to decrypt.
2. Once the form data is encrypted it sends the encrypted data to the HIPAA FORMS Service API where it remains encrypted on a HIPAA Compliant storage solution.
3. When someone with login credentials logs into your Wordpress administrator dashboard with either and administrator or hipaa user role that user can then go to the HIPAA FORMS plugin interface and view the forms that have been submitted.  While you can view the decrypted forms here the data never actually leaves the HIPAA FORMS Service servers, you're simply pulling them from the api, decrypting and viewing in your browser, the data never actually touches your hosting server.
4. The only way the data can leave the HIPAA FORMS Service servers is if you click the "generate pdf" button and create an encrypted password protected pdf file.  At this point you can print or save the pdf to your hard drive but since the pdf remains encrypted and password protected the form data remains safe in transit.
5. Once you close the pdf generation window the pdf file is then destroyed on the HIPAA FORMS Service server removing any chance of a bad actor gaining access to the file.
6. Each time a user accesses the HIPAA FORMS plugin admin interface a log entry is created and stored on the HIPAA FORMS Service which you can review at any time from the HIPAA FORMS plugin interface.  This is required by HIPAA Regulations to ensure any potential data breach can be back-traced.
7. Since the form data is encrypted and remains on the HIPAA FORMS Service database we ensure that protected data can not be tampered with and changed by anyone.
8. Both a SSL certificate and a BAA agreement between the user and Code Monkeys LLC (the company that developed and maintains the HIPAA FORMS Service and Wordpress plugin) is required.  The ability to submit or view forms is disabled until both of these requirements have been met.

NEW IN V1.5.5:
Version 1.5.5 is our first "major" update to the plugin since releasing it.  This update includes an improved user interface and the following specific form settings:
1. Option to show/hide the signature field
2. Option to specify a success message or a redirect url after a form is submitted
3. Option to set who can see the submitted forms with the following options:
    A. All users with admin/hipaa user role
    B. Only specific users
    C. Only a specific doctor/user selected within a form (ie. Patient selects a specific doctor in a form, only that doctor will see the submitted form).  NOTE: Admins see all forms regardless of settings.

While we believe we've made the entire process as simple as possible we also understand that there may be questions or issues sometimes that the user needs addressed.  Given the urgency and importance of a service such as this we've built a complete support ticket system directly into the HIPAA FORMS Wordpress plugin interface to allow the users to submit and track support tickets without ever needing to leave their own administrator dashboard.  The HIPAA FORMS Service team at Code Monkeys LLC strives to respond to tickets within 1 business day.  Users can also call Code Monkeys LLC directly for support between 9am and 5pm CST.

NOTE: A subscription-based license key to access the HIPAA FORMS Service API is required from <a href="https://www.hipaaforms.online" target="_blank">https://www.hipaaforms.online</a> in order to submit and view forms (a free version is available, no credit card required).  Your website must also have SSL enabled (url should show https://).


== Web Designer Friendly ==
We know that the owners or board members of dental clinics, health clinics, hospitals and insurance agencies aren’t the ones that will be implementing this service.  It’s YOU, the web designers and developers that have the task of finding a solution and making it work.

Our initial primary goal was to build a solution for our own website builds so we’ve done everything we can to make the installation, setup and implementation of this service as seamless and efficient as possible.  If you can build a contact form with Caldera Forms you can build HIPAA Compliant web forms with our service, in fact once you have the plugin setup and build the form all you really need to do is check a box and your form is instantly compliant.

We also want to ensure that YOU have the knowledge and ability to protect both yourself and your client.  While we require your client to sign a BAA agreement with us we don’t require that the web designer/developer have a BAA in place but we STRONGLY recommend it.  A BAA agreement protects your client, not you or us but it is actually REQUIRED according to HIPAA Regulations and without the BAA in place your client is not in compliance and may be violating both federal and state privacy laws.  While YOU may not have a legal obligation to have a BAA in place with your client, as your client’s technical expert on all thing relating to their website have a moral obligation to make your client aware that a BAA agreement should be in place between you and them.

If you’re not an agency or freelance but work on the website directly for a company you should still ensure that your company has a BAA agreement in place for all employees and any 3rd party IT professionals that may have access to protected health information.  Fines for violating HIPAA Regulations can be in the six figures and your company could be out of business leaving you looking for a new job if your company is not compliant.

Regardless of if you’re an agency, freelancer or work directly for a company that takes protected private health information, if you have any questions or need help with anything relating to compliance or how to put a BAA agreement in place between yourself and your client please don’t hesitate to submit a support ticket or give us a call.


== Screenshots ==

2. This is an example form showing the appended HIPAA Compliant badge, privacy statement agreement and signature field.


== Installation ==
1.  Upload your plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins' directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

SETUP:
First you must get an API license key for the HIPAA FORMS Service which does offer a free subscription option.  This service is what handles the storage and PDF generation of the forms and forms CAN NOT be submitted without a subscription.  Once you subscribe to the service a license key will be generated and emailed to you.  Visit <a href="https://www.hipaaforms.online" target="_blank">HIPAA FORMS Service</a> to purchase a subscription.

Next make sure you have Caldera Forms or Gravity Forms installed and active.  Caldera is a free form builder plugin that can easily be installed from the "plugins->add" interface and searching for Caldera Forms.  Gravity Forms is a premium paid form builder plugin that can be purchased <a href="https://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a> No additional extensions are needed.

Now that you have your license key and Caldera or Gravity Forms installed and activated, go to the "Settings" tab and add your license key, select your preferred compatible form builder plugin (ie. Caldera or Gravity), enter the email address you wish to receive form submission notices to and set your preferred time zone.  If you plan on using the custom HIPAA FORMS user role you can also set what permissions that role should have here.

Once the plugin settings are save you need to create a form.  You must have 4 required fields in the form which are needed in order to filter/search the submitted forms. These fields are:

First Name: Must have a text input
Caldera: Must have the slug "first_name"
Gravity: Must have the class "hipaa_forms_first_name"

Last Name: Must have a text input
Caldera: Must have the slug "last_name"
Gravity: Must have the class "hipaa_forms_last_name"

Phone: Must have a text or phone input
Caldera: Must have the slug "phone"
Gravity: Must have the class "hipaa_forms_phone"

Email: Must have a text or email input
Caldera: Must have the slug "email"
Gravity: Must have the class "hipaa_forms_email"

These standardized fields are required in order to search or filter the forms by these options.

If a form has all of the required fields then you will have the option to select it by checking the box at the left of the form. If the form does NOT have all of the required fields a warning icon will show next to the form. Clicking on the warning/toggle icon will display what fields are missing.

Once you have checked the box next to a form it should be HIPAA Compliant. To verify the form is now compliant go to where the form is rendered on the page and you should now see an additional section at the bottom of the form right above the submit button showing a checkbox to agree to the HIPAA privacy agreement, a badge showing the form is encrypted and HIPAA compliant and the signature field which a user can sign by left clicking and dragging their mouse or by simply using their finger or stylus if on a touch screen.  You should also see a padlock on the submit button indicating that the form submit function is secure.  If you do NOT see these something is not correct and the form will NOT be HIPAA compliant and you should submit a support ticket so our support staff can troubleshoot the issue before attempting to use the form.  It is your responsibility to ensure forms are in a compliant state before allowing patients to submit private protected health information and failure to do so could result in fines.

When someone submits the HIPAA Compliant form the default form submit button is replaced with a custom button (indicated by the padlock icon) and instead the form will be encrypted and an API call is made to the HIPAA FORMS API and saved into a HIPAA Compliant database storage solution. The only fields that are not encrypted are the required first name, last name, phone # and email in order to allow searching/filtering the forms in the "Submitted Forms" tab. The form itself (and all fields within it) are encrypted at the time of submission in order to protect the data in transit as well as at rest within the HIPAA FORMS Service data solution. If you tried to look at the form at this point you would just see a long string of nonsense letters, numbers and characters and would not be able to see any of the actual form data.

The only way the form data can be viewed at this point is by logging into the Wordpress admin panel with valid username and password credentials for an account with the appropriate user role associated to it (administrator or hipaaforms) and opening the "Submitted Forms" tab within the HIPAA FORMS interface. Here another API request is sent to the HIPAA FORMS API and the submitted forms data is pulled. Once the data is returned from the API the associated encryption keys are then used to decrypt the form data and then display that data on the screen. While you can view this data within this tab the actual data is never stored anywhere on your server, it simply pulls it from the HIPAA FORMS Service data solution and displays it. The only way for this data to actually ever leave our secure system is to generate an encrypted PDF file with password protection.

To generate a PDF version of the form click the "Generate PDF" button next to the form. This will bring up a modal window (popup) asking you to set a password. Once a password is provided click generate. The modal window should update with a link to open the newly created PDF, once you enter the password the form will load and you will be able to view the form, print it or save it to your computer.  If you do not keep track of the password you will NOT be able to view the PDF file.

The PDF file must be encrypted and password protected to ensure that the form can never be intercepted and read as it's transferred between the data base and you. This should also help keep you more compliant internally as the file can not be read without the correct password once it's saved to your computer. While ensuring that the PDF files are encrypted and password protected should keep the data safe and compliant we HIGHLY recommend that any computer you download the PDFs to have encrypted hard drives to be safe and ensure compliance. Once you print or download the PDF to your computer Code Monkeys LLC and all associates covered within the BAA agreement bear no liability for the handling of the data.

We strongly recommend that you keep up with HIPAA regulation changes and that you work with a qualified attorney and/or HIPAA Compliance professional to ensure compliance.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
REQUIREMENTS:

YOU MUST HAVE CALDERA OR GRAVITY FORMS INSTALLED & ACTIVE
Currently the HIPAA Forms plugins is only integrated with Caldera & Gravity Forms.  Caldera Forms is a free form builder plugin and can be installed by searching for it in the Wordpress plugin repository (plugins->add new).  Gravity Forms is a premium paid form builder plugin that can be purchased <a href="https://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a> No additional extensions are needed.

YOU MUST HAVE SSL ENABLED
The HIPAA FORMS plugin checks to ensure SSL (https) is enabled and being used.  Any forms set as HIPAA Compliant will be deactivated if the url does not start with https://.  If you're unable to setup SSL with your current host or if your current host's cost is too expensive consider a managed hosting (and optional Wordpress maintenance package) from Code Monkeys. We automatically issue free SSL certificates to all of our hosting customers. <a href="https://www.codemonkeysllc.com/hosting" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS</a>

YOU MUST HAVE A VALID LICENSE KEY
You can purchase a license key from <a href="https://www.hipaaforms.online" target="_blank">hipaaforms.online</a> as a free, monthly, quarterly or annual subscription basis.  While this plugin is free to install and use, the HIPAA FORMS plugin is integrated with an API service and you must have an active account with a valid license key to use this service. A free API subcription is available but limits you to 1 form and up to 25 form submissions per month while the paid subscription is $55/mo and allows unlimited forms and form submissions.  If your paid subscription expires you will automatically be dropped down to the basic plan and limited to 25 form submissions per month.

A subscription account & license key is required as a BAA agreement is required and the encrypted E-PHI data is stored on the HIPAA Forms API database in order to meet HIPAA/PIPEDA regulations and there must be a way to validate who you are and that all of the requirements are in place to do so.

YOU CAN ONLY SUBMIT & VIEW FORMS FROM YOUR ASSOCIATED DOMAIN
Forms can only be submitted and viewed from the domain you added to your HIPAA FORMS Service subscription account at the time of checkout.  When a request is made to the HIPAA FORMS Service API it does a check against your license key, domain and if a BAA agreement has been signed.  If any of those things are not valid the API request is denied and an error will be returned specifying what the issue is.  Only one license key and domain is allowed per subscription meaning you can NOT use the same license or domain on more than one website.  This is done as an additional security measure to ensure that even if a license key is stolen form data would not be accessible.  If you need to change the domain associated with your license key you can do so by logging in at <a href="https://www.hipaaforms.online/my-account" target="_blank">https://www.hipaaforms.online/my-account</a>

YOU MUST SIGN THE BAA AGREEMENT
A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) typically is required for companies that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to ensure that protected health information (PHI) is appropriately safeguarded. Failure to manage data privacy risks with non-business associate vendors may lead to both violations of HIPAA and state privacy laws.  The BAA agreement is in place for your protection and forms can not be submitted or viewed until it is in place.  We also recommend that you have a BAA in place with your web designer if they work on the site as a 3rd party contractor.


COMMON ISSUES:

EMAIL NOTICES GOING TO SPAM
Default Wordpress emails get sent through your host's domain which often times will be flagged as spam.  We highly recommend installing an email SMTP plugin for Wordpress and using the SMTP settings for a legit email address. This will allow Wordpress to send emails from the SMTP server instead of from your host.

FORMS ARE DISABLED / HIPAA COMPLIANT BADGE DOESN'T APPEAR
If you do NOT see the additional section at the bottom of the form with the HIPAA compliant badge then there is an issue somewhere and the form will NOT be disabled as it will not be HIPAA compliant. A common reason this might happen is if you do NOT have SSL (https://) enabled or if the user is viewing the http:// version of the page. We strongly recommend that you setup a redirect in your .htaccess file or by using a plugin to ensure all pages are served the https:// version of the page. If this is the case the form will be disabled and you should see a warning notice at the bottom of the form instead of the badge.

Another common reason you might not see this section is if your license key has expired. If this is the case you should see a warning notice at the bottom of the form and the form will be disabled. Reactivating your license key will solve the issue and your form will be enabled again.

A less common reason for this would be if another plugin is causing a Javascript/jQuery error or conflict.

NONCE EXPIRED ERROR
Wordpress uses a nonce (number used once) to help secure your site during things like form submissions and AJAX calls, although its not really a "number used once" in the traditional sense.  Instead this is a hash token that can be used multiple times within a 12 or 24 hour period at which point the nonce will expire.  What happens is if your cache expiration is set beyond 12 hours the nonce will also be cached resulting in a validation error as that nonce will have expired.

This is not just a specific issue to our plugin, if your cache expiration is set too long it can cause issues with many other plugins as well.

To solve this issue make sure you have any caching plugins such as W3TC or Super Cache set to expire before 12 hours.

If the problem persists with caching plugins completely deactivated then its most likely an issue with a server-side cache on your hosting server.  You will need to contact your hosting company and request the caching be reduced to under 12 hours.  If you are on an ultra-cheap shared hosting solution from someone like HostGator you will most likely need to move to another host as they will not adjust their caching to play well with Wordpress nonces and honestly if you rely on your website for you business which we would assume you do if you are using this plugin then you really should spend a little extra for a good reliable host, you really do get what you pay for when it comes to hosting solutions.

LONGER FORMS ARE SUBMITTING BUT NOT SHOW THE FORM INFORMATION IN THE SUBMITTED FORMS VIEW
Very long forms may exceed the max_input_vars setting in your hosting server's PHP.ini.  This will cause the form to submit however the actual form will most likely be empty and not actually sent through the API since it's larger than your limit.

To solve this increase you max_input_vars in your PHP.ini.  If you are on a shared hosing account and do not have access to the PHP.ini settings or are unsure on how to change them there are 3rd party plugins available in the Wordpress plugin repository that will allow you to change your settings from the Wordpress admin panel.


COMMON QUESTIONS:

WHAT IS A BAA?
A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) typically is required for companies that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to ensure that protected health information (PHI) is appropriately safeguarded. Failure to manage data privacy risks with non-business associate vendors may lead to both violations of HIPAA and state privacy laws.  You will be unable to use the HIPAA FORMS Service until you have signed the BAA with Code Monkeys LLC (the developers of the service) and will receive a notice to do so within the "submitted forms" tab as well as in the settings tab until it has been signed.  We HIGHLY recommend that you have a BAA in place with your web designer as well if you use a 3rd party contractor for web design service.

CAN WE USE OUR OWN BAA INSTEAD OF YOURS?
Yes, in most cases we will sign your BAA in place of our default agreement.

You can email your signed BAA to us at spencer at codemonkeysllc.com. We will review it and assuming everything looks good we will sign it and replace the BAA on file for your account.

CAN WE MODIFY/EXTEND THIS PLUGIN?
WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT MODIFYING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS PLUGIN!

This plugin is released under the GPL license and is open source allowing you to modify the plugin however we strongly recommend against attempting to modify the core functionality of the plugin.  The plugin simply acts as an interface to the API service where most of the "under the hood" functionality lives however some functionality such as encryption prior to sending the form data to the API happens within the plugin.  Breaking or disabling this encryption process could result in non-encrypted private protected sensitive health information being submitted which would be a HIPAA violation and may lead to both violations of HIPAA and state privacy laws.

While we recommend not modifying the core functionality of the plugin changing the CSS/Styles is totally fine and recommended.

CAN IMAGES/FILES BE ATTACHED TO FORMS?
We offer a secure HIPAA compliant file upload add-on option with unlimited uploads and unlimited storage to our service for an additional $30/mo or $300/yr. This option is not available with our basic free subscription.

With our file upload option enabled the basic file upload fields within Caldera or Gravity Forms are over-ridden by our plugin and the files are submitted directly from the browser to our secure encrypted file storage system when the form is submitted.

If files have been uploaded and attached to a submitted form you’ll be able to view those files from within the submitted form interface of the HIPAA Forms dashboard.

Secure generic pre-signed access URLs are generated when you load the submitted form that expire after 1 hour for greater security.

HOW CAN WE USE THIS ON A STAGING SITE?
The answer to this question depends on HOW you handle a staging version of the website.

You are only able to submit and view forms from within the domain associated with your license key.  If your staging version in under a subdomain of that domain you will be fine, the root domain is all that matters.  However if your staging version is under a different domain you will only be able to use the service from staging OR live, not both at the same time.

If you are "pre-launch" we would recommend setting the domain on your HIPAA FORMS Service account to your staging server domain first.  Then once you are ready to go live simply switch the domain to the live domain.

We understand that this can be frustrating to developers that do not have a staging version under the same root domain as we're developers ourselves.  We are exploring possible solutions to this for future releases to help with this issue.
