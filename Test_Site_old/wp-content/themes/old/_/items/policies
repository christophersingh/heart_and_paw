Administration of the vaccine is at the discretion and medical recommendation of the attending veterinarian.\n\n### Stay\n\nAll pets should be healthy enough for a stay away from home.  For the wellbeing of all our guests, Heart + Paw cannot accept pets that have a terminal illness or pets with a contagious, communicable disease and\/or illness.  Pets that require medications are welcome to stay with the approval of a veterinarian.  The administration of most medications is included with the stay, but additional fees will be associated with injections.  Pets displaying signs of illness including, but not limited to, incontinence, severe lack of mobility, respiratory distress, or seizures cannot be accepted.  If your pet is not current on the necessary vaccines, we can help you schedule an appointment with our Care team.\n* Dogs: We request that you provide proof of vaccination for Rabies, DHPP, and Bordetella from your veterinarian. If the Bordetella vaccine has never been given, or if it has expired, a 7-day waiting period is recommended after the administration.  Though not required, it is recommended that the canine influenza vaccine be current for all dogs.\n* Cats: We request that you provide proof of vaccination for Rabies and FVRCP from your veterinarian.\n\n### Play\n\nAll dogs should be healthy enough to participate in a PLAY group.  We request that you provide proof of vaccination for Rabies, DHPP, and Bordetella from your veterinarian. If the Bordetella vaccine has never been given, or if it has expired, a 7-day waiting period is recommended after the administration.  Though not required, it is recommended that the canine influenza vaccine be current for all dogs.  If your pet is not current on the necessary vaccines, we can help you schedule an appointment with our Care team.  If your dog has been dropped off to play and displays signs of illness, they will be removed from the group.  For the safety of your pet and their friends, your pet may not return to the play group until their symptoms have resolved or documented approval has been received from a veterinarian.  \n \n### Style\n  \nAll pets should present in good health.  If your pet is not current on the necessary vaccines, we can help you schedule an appointment with our Care team. \n* Dogs: We request that you provide proof of vaccination for Rabies, DHPP, and Bordetella from your veterinarian. \n* Cats: We request that you provide proof of vaccination for Rabies and FVRCP from your veterinarian. \n* Rabies is not required for pets less than 4 months of age.\n\n---\n\n## Behavior\n\nWe understand that there are some pets that may get anxious while they’re away from home.  We will do our best to provide a stress-free environment but may have to decline specific services until they are feeling more comfortable.\n\n### Play\n \nThe group will be closely monitored by a trained play coordinator who will be aware of dogs that are showing signs of aggression, stress, and fatigue.  These pets may be removed for both the safety of others, as well as their own.  Please reference our Consultation, Behavior, and Health Policies for more information.\n\n---\n\n## Parasite Control\n\n### Play + Stay\n \nWe recommend that all pets be treated with an effective form of flea and tick prevention.  If external parasites are discovered upon check-in, the pet will be treated with an effective and appropriate form of parasite control at the expense of the owner.  If internal parasites are discovered during a stay, the pet will be treated appropriately by a veterinarian at the expense of the owner.\n\n---\n\n## Intact Pets\n\n### Play + Stay\n\nAny pet over 12 months of age must be altered (spayed\/neutered). We recognize that intact pets under 12 months require special staff supervision, therefore we can only accommodate 3 intact pets under the age of 12 months on a daily basis.\n\n---\n\n## Waitlist\n\n### Play\n  \nPlease let us know if you won’t be joining us as soon as you can as a courtesy to our community. If an intact pet Play reservation is cancelled after 4:30 PM local time the day prior, the first intact Pet Parent on the waitlist will receive a text from Heart + Paw, asking if they would like the available spot.\n* The recipient of the text will have 30 minutes to respond YES.  Once sent, the reservation will be confirmed by both text and email.\n* If the recipient responds NO, or does not respond within 30 minutes, they will remain inactive.  Heart + Paw will then text the next intact Pet Parent on the wait list.\n\n---"}],"public":true}
